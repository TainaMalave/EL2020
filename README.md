# Embedded Linux Midterm Assignment

## What is the purpose of this branch?: 
   - The purpose of this branch is to contain all the content related to my midterm project for CPS 342 - Embedded Linux. The midterm project for this class is to take the flaskServer.py and index.html files and get them to communicate with each other and work with our temperature logger scripts. It will display a website that graphs the temperatures based on the temperatures that the logger script reads in from our temperature sensors. Finally, we were to create a button on the index.html page and have it communicate so that when it is pressed, it blinks the LED light on our breadboards. 

## What is needed?: 
    • Hardware: Raspberry Pi, breadboard, LED, temperature sensor. 

    • Software: You will need to install the Adafruit DHT Python library. Do this by simply typing in the following:

        • sudo python3 -m pip install -upgrade pip setuptools wheel
        • sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
