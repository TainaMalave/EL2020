# Blink Temp 

### What Does It Do?:
- This program uses a rapsberry pi, breadboard, an LED, touch sensor, and a temperature detector. 
- When you hook up everything properly on the breadboard, and you run blinkTemp.py, it should make the LED blink when you touch the sensor, read the temperature and display the temperature in the terminal. 

### What Do You Need?:
1. **Hardware:** LED, wires, breadboard, raspberry pi, touch sensor, temperature detector. 
2. **Software:** You will need to install the Adafruit
DHT Python library. Do this by simply typing in the following: 
    
    * sudo python3 -m pip install -upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    * sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT

Assuming everything is wired up correct, the program should work!
